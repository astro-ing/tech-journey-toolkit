# Resume tips

1. **Treat the résumé as an ad, not a biography**
    - Its sole job is to win a callback, not to land the offer.
    - Write it for the first human who sees it—**the recruiter**, not the hiring manager.
        
2. **Optimise for fast scanning**
    - Keep total word count to roughly **400–500 words** and limit to **one or two pages** even with several years’ experience.
    - Use tight bullet points; avoid dense paragraphs or long summaries.
    - Lead with a micro-summary: • total years of relevant experience • 2-3 business domains you’ve worked in.
        
3. **Focus on business impact**
    - Frame accomplishments around money saved, revenue generated, efficiency gains, risk reduced, etc.
    - Relegate deep technical details to the interview; recruiters need plain-language outcomes.
        
4. **Control your jargon**
    - Excessive acronyms or niche tech terms make the document unreadable for non-technical gatekeepers.
    - One technical bullet per job can list the key stack; skip a standalone “Skills” laundry list.
        
5. **One strong version beats dozens of ATS variants**
    - Chasing perfect keyword alignment or making 75 micro-tweaks rarely improves callback rate.
    - Instead, test the résumé’s effectiveness by tracking “applications → recruiter callbacks” and iterate only if the rate is low.
        
6. **Avoid “too-perfect” keyword stuffing**
    - Résumés that mirror the posting word-for-word can look fabricated and raise suspicion with hiring managers.
        
7. **Respect the recruiter’s time**
    - Eliminate fluff (“team player,” “results-oriented”) and dated tools.
    - Ensure formatting is clean, consistent, and ATS-safe (simple fonts, no text boxes).
        
8. **Ethics and authenticity matter**
	- Never inflate titles or fabricate projects; credibility is checked during interviews and references.
        
9. **Prioritise networking over résumé tinkering**
    - Once the résumé is solid, spend the majority of job-search hours building relationships and referrals—conversion rates are far higher through the “side door.”
        
10. **Measure, then adjust**
    - If after ~20 targeted applications you’re not seeing recruiter interest, tweak headline bullets and impact statements; otherwise, keep networking.

**_Any other Questions?_**

At the end of the interview, you will usually be asked if you have any other questions.

70% of your questions will probably have been answered during the interview, however, we recommend you have some extra questions written down to show you’ve prepared and you’re eager to learn more. At worst, you can refer to your notes to say, you’ve covered the main ones noted, however, we recommend your questions should be focused on; the position, product, team size and business growth plans.
