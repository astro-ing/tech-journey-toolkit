# Job Application to Offer Toolkit

This module provides guides and Obsidian-ready templates to accelerate the path from application to offer, with prompts for resumes, applications, interview prep, and structured note-taking.

## Guides

- **job_application_tips.md** – concise, practical advice on resumes, interviews, delivery, and rehearsal with emphasis on impact and networking.

## Templates

- **application_prompt_template.md** – builder for recruiter responses and cover letters with tone, structure, and fact-check rules.
- **resume_prompt_template.md** – resume generator with ATS-aware rules, quantified bullets, and optional skills/summary blocks.
- **technical_interview_prompt_template.md** – question bank/mock/study plan generator with rubrics, pacing, and tool-tailoring.
- **interview_note_template.md** – structured interview prep and note capture with links to tips and question planning.

### Usage

- Duplicate a template, fill USER_INPUT blocks, run the Prompt block in an LLM, and paste outputs back for iteration.
- Track callback rate and iterate messaging, impact bullets, and openings after 10–20 targeted sends.
