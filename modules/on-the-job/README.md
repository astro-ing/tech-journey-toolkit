# On the Job Toolkit

This module aims to support daily tracking, reflection, and productivity once you have started your role.
It complements the **Job Application to Offer** toolkit by focusing on sustainable work habits and documentation practices.

## Templates

- **daily_standup_template.md** – Capture blockers, progress, and priorities for daily stand-ups.
- **daily_journal_template.md** – Structured note-taking for daily reflections and learnings.
- **weekly_journal_template.md** – Summarise weekly progress, challenges, and goals. The daily templates were designed to be inserted into here.
- **timesheet_template.xlsx** – Track working hours with formulas for statistics (with a `.csv` preview for GitHub viewability).

## Usage

Import these templates into your Obsidian vault (or similar note-taking setup) to streamline work logs, stand-ups, and time tracking. This helps maintain consistency, support retrospectives, and improve knowledge sharing on the job.
